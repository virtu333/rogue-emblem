1\. Game Overview

1.1 Concept

Emblem Rogue is a tactical RPG that blends Fire Emblem's grid-based
combat, class systems, and character progression with roguelike run
structure, randomized encounters, and meta-progression. The game
features SNES-inspired pixel art with modern flourishes, evoking the
aesthetic of classics like Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade and Octopath
Traveler.

1.2 Core Fantasy

You are a Lord leading a growing warband through a campaign of tactical
battles. Each run, you recruit allies, find equipment, and develop your
force---but defeat means starting over with only your Lord and the
lessons learned. Over many runs, you unlock new classes, improve your
starting capabilities, and discover special characters who join your
permanent roster of potential recruits.

1.3 Platform & Technology

The game is built as a browser-based application using HTML5 Canvas and
JavaScript (Phaser.js framework). All game data (classes, skills, items,
enemies, maps) is defined in JSON for easy iteration and modding.

1.4 Art Style

SNES-era pixel art with a 16x16 or 32x32 base tile size. Character
sprites use a limited, cohesive palette. Battle scenes use side-view
sprite animations. UI is clean and readable with pixel-font text and
modern layout sensibilities.

2\. Core Loop & Run Structure

2.1 The Run

A single run represents one campaign attempt. The player begins with
their Lord (and, through meta-progression, potentially stronger starting
conditions) and progresses through a series of branching nodes leading
to a final boss encounter.

2.2 Campaign Structure

One campaign consists of 3 Acts, each culminating in a boss encounter,
followed by a short Post-Act sequence of elite skirmishes leading to the
Final Boss. A successful run contains roughly 20--25 total battles.

  ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- -------------------------------
  **Phase**   **Nodes**   **Map       **Deploy    **Description**
                          Size**      Limit**     

  Act 1       6--8        8x6 to 10x8 3--4 units  Early battles, building your
                                                  warband. Mostly rout
                                                  objectives. Ends with Act 1
                                                  Boss.

  Act 2       6--8        10x8 to     4--5 units  Rising difficulty, more varied
                          12x8                    objectives. Elite enemies
                                                  appear. Ends with Act 2 Boss.

  Act 3       6--8        10x8 to     5--6 units  Full tactical complexity. All
                          12x10                   objectives in play. Ends with
                                                  Act 3 Boss.

  Post-Act    3--4        12x10+      6 units     Elite skirmishes with premium
                                                  rewards leading to the Final
                                                  Boss.
  ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- -------------------------------

2.3 Node Map (Between Battles)

Between battles, the player navigates a branching node map (similar to
Slay the Spire). Each Act has its own node map with branching paths of
varying risk and reward. Node types include:

-   **Battle:** Standard combat encounter with randomized enemies and
    map. Rewards: XP, gold, choice of 1 loot drop.

-   **Elite Battle:** Tougher encounter against a miniboss drawn from a
    random pool. Rewards: XP, gold, choice of 2 loot drops (higher
    quality).

-   **Boss Battle:** Fixed boss encounter at the end of each Act.
    Non-random, learnable. Rewards: guaranteed powerful item, large XP,
    meta-progression currency.

-   **Recruit Event:** A combat map where a green NPC ally appears. Your
    Lord must reach and speak to them to recruit. The NPC fights
    independently with basic AI but is not suicidal. Recruiting adds
    them to your roster for the run.

-   **Shop:** Spend gold to buy weapons, accessories, skill scrolls, or
    stat boosters. Limited random inventory.

-   **Rest:** Heal all units to full HP. Optionally, a brief narrative
    scene or dialogue.

2.4 Run Failure

When the Lord is defeated in battle, the run ends. The player retains
meta-progression currency earned during the run and returns to the Home
Base to spend it. All recruited units, equipment, and in-run progress
are lost. Special characters return to the recruitment pool for future
runs.

3\. Combat System

3.1 Grid & Turn Structure

Combat takes place on a grid-based map with varied terrain. The game
uses a Player Phase / Enemy Phase turn structure (classic Fire Emblem
style). During Player Phase, all allied units can move and act in any
order. During Enemy Phase, all enemy units act.

3.2 Unit Actions

Each unit can perform one move and one action per turn. Actions include:
Attack (engage an adjacent or ranged enemy), Use Item (consumable from
inventory), Wait (end turn in place), Talk (Lord only, to recruit green
NPCs), Seize (Lord only, on objective tiles), and Trade (swap items with
an adjacent ally).

3.3 Damage Formula

The damage formula follows classic Fire Emblem conventions:

**Physical Damage:** ATK (STR + Weapon Might) − DEF

**Magical Damage:** ATK (MAG + Weapon Might) − RES

**Hit Rate:** Weapon Hit + (SKL × 2) + LCK − Enemy Avoid

**Avoid:** (SPD × 2) + LCK + Terrain Bonus

**Critical Rate:** SKL / 2 + Weapon Crit + Skill Bonuses − Enemy LCK

**Critical Damage:** 3× normal damage

**Double Attack:** If unit's SPD exceeds enemy's SPD by 5 or more, unit
attacks twice.

3.4 Weapon Triangle

The weapon triangle provides a moderate advantage to favorable matchups.
The effect is intentionally lighter than some FE titles to reduce RNG
frustration.

  ----------------- ----------- ----------- -----------------------------
  **Matchup**       **Hit       **Damage    **Notes**
                    Bonus**     Bonus**     

  Swords → Axes     +10 Hit     +1 Damage   Sword users are accurate vs
                                            Axes

  Axes → Lances     +10 Hit     +1 Damage   Axe users overpower Lances

  Lances → Swords   +10 Hit     +1 Damage   Lance users outrange Swords

  Disadvantage      −10 Hit     −1 Damage   Reverse of above
  ----------------- ----------- ----------- -----------------------------

Magic and bows exist outside the weapon triangle. Mastery rank enhances
weapon triangle bonuses to +15 Hit / +2 Damage (and reduces disadvantage
to −5 Hit / −1 Damage).

3.5 Terrain

Terrain tiles affect movement cost, evasion, and defense. Terrain types
are assigned during map generation and add tactical variety.

  ------------- --------- ---------- ---------- ----------------------------
  **Terrain**   **Move    **Avoid    **DEF      **Notes**
                Cost**    Bonus**    Bonus**    

  Plain         1         0          0          Standard tile

  Forest        2         +20        +1         Infantry and fliers only

  Mountain      3         +30        +2         Infantry only

  Fort          1         +20        +2         Heals 10% HP per turn

  Throne        1         +30        +3         Boss/seize tile. Heals 10%
                                                HP.

  Wall          ---       ---        ---        Impassable

  Water         3 (fly:   +10        0          Fliers and certain classes
                1)                              only
  ------------- --------- ---------- ---------- ----------------------------

3.6 Fog of War

Some maps feature partial or full fog of war as a random modifier. In
fog, the player can only see tiles within each unit's vision range
(typically 3 tiles for most units, 5 for Thieves/Assassins). Torches and
certain skills can extend vision. Fog maps reward careful play and
scouting.

3.7 Map Objectives

While early maps are primarily rout (defeat all enemies), later Acts
introduce varied objectives:

-   **Rout:** Defeat all enemy units.

-   **Seize:** Lord must reach and capture a specific tile (throne,
    gate).

-   **Defend:** Protect a tile or NPC for X turns against waves.

-   **Escape:** Move all surviving units to an exit point.

-   **Survive:** Endure X turns of enemy waves. Rewards scale with
    enemies defeated.

-   **Protect & Recruit:** A green NPC is on the map. Recruit them
    before they fall. Enemies will target the NPC.

Bonus objectives (e.g., complete in fewer turns, no unit losses) grant
extra gold or XP.

3.8 Enemy AI

Enemy AI follows classic Fire Emblem patterns with minor enhancements:

-   Enemies attack if they can deal damage and survive the counterattack
    (or if they can secure a kill regardless).

-   Enemies prioritize targets they can kill, then targets with weapon
    triangle advantage against, then lowest-DEF/RES targets.

-   Enemies do not suicidally attack into massively unfavorable
    matchups.

-   Boss enemies are stationary until a player unit enters their range
    (classic FE throne boss behavior).

-   Miniboss enemies may have unique AI patterns (e.g., always targets
    the Lord, retreats when below 25% HP).

-   Green NPC allies use basic defensive AI: they attack nearby enemies
    but do not advance aggressively. They prioritize self-preservation
    over kills.

4\. Unit System

4.1 Stats

Every unit has the following stats. Base stats come from their class and
character, and grow on level up based on growth rates.

  --------------- ---------- ------------------------------------------------
  **Stat**        **Abbr**   **Effect**

  Hit Points      HP         Unit is defeated when HP reaches 0.

  Strength        STR        Physical attack power. Added to weapon might for
                             physical attacks.

  Magic           MAG        Magical attack power. Added to weapon might for
                             magical attacks.

  Skill           SKL        Accuracy and critical hit chance.

  Speed           SPD        Evasion and double attack threshold. If SPD
                             exceeds enemy by 5+, attacks twice.

  Defense         DEF        Reduces physical damage taken.

  Resistance      RES        Reduces magical damage taken.

  Luck            LCK        Minor contributions to hit, avoid, and crit
                             avoidance.

  Movement        MOV        Number of tiles a unit can traverse per turn.
  --------------- ---------- ------------------------------------------------

4.2 Experience & Leveling

Units earn XP from combat actions: dealing damage (small XP), defeating
an enemy (large XP), healing allies (moderate XP for staff users), and
completing objectives. XP thresholds increase per level. On level up,
each stat has a chance to increase by 1 based on the unit's growth
rates. Growth rates are expressed as percentages (e.g., 60% STR growth
means a 60% chance STR increases on level up). Level cap is 20 for base
classes and 20 for promoted classes (40 total effective levels).

4.3 Growth Rates

Growth rates come from two sources that stack:

-   **Class Growths:** Each class has a set of growth rates. These are
    semi-randomized within a range when a unit is generated (e.g., a
    Fighter's STR growth might range from 50--70%, rolled once at
    recruitment).

-   **Character Growths:** Lords and Special Characters have fixed
    personal growth rates that add to their class growths. This makes
    them more reliable and distinct. Generic recruited units do not have
    personal growths.

4.4 Promotion

At level 10 or higher, base-class units can promote to an advanced class
using a Promotion Item (found as loot or purchased). Promotion resets
the unit's level to 1 (of the promoted class) while retaining all stats.
Promoted classes gain: stat bonuses on promotion, access to additional
weapon types, a new innate skill (meta-progression required), and higher
stat caps.

4.5 Weapon Ranks

Weapon proficiency uses a simplified three-tier system:

  ------------- ------------------------------- -------------------------
  **Rank**      **Effect**                      **How Obtained**

  Can't Use     Unit cannot equip this weapon   Default for weapon types
                type.                           outside class
                                                proficiency.

  Proficient    Unit can equip standard weapons Granted by class. Base
                of this type.                   classes start with 1
                                                proficiency.

  Mastery       Small stat boost (+2 Hit, +1    Granted by promotion (1
                Dmg). Enhanced weapon triangle  additional mastery).
                (+15/+2 advantage, −5/−1        Meta-progression can
                disadvantage). Can equip the    unlock mastery for
                strongest weapons.              additional types.
  ------------- ------------------------------- -------------------------

Classes start with 1 weapon type at Proficient. Promotion upgrades that
weapon to Mastery and grants Proficient in a second type.
Meta-progression can grant additional weapon proficiencies or upgrade
existing ones to Mastery.

5\. Classes

support unit found only through specific recruit events.

5.2 Lord Classes

Lord classes are exclusive to Lord characters. Each Lord starts as a
base Lord variant and promotes into an advanced form. Lords have unique
personal skills and fixed personal growth rates.

  ------------- ------------- ------------ --------------- ------------------

The default starting Lord is the basic Lord → Great Lord. Additional
Lords are unlocked through meta-progression. Each Lord can be
extensively customized via meta-progression: improved growths, different
starting weapon ranks, customized starting skills, and eventually class
changes that alter their promotion path.

5.3 Special Character Classes

Some Special Characters have unique class variants (e.g., Wyvern Rider →
Wyvern Lord) that are not available to generic recruits. These are
unlocked as the Special Character is unlocked via meta-progression.

6\. Skill System

6.1 Skill Types

Skills are divided into two categories:

-   **Innate Skills:** Permanently attached to a unit by class or
    character. Cannot be removed or swapped. Unlocked via
    meta-progression: 1 skill for the base class, 1 additional skill on
    promotion.

-   **Equipped Skills:** Found as loot drops (Skill Scrolls) during
    runs. Placed in equip slots. Can be swapped between battles.
    Starting equip slot count: 1. Meta-progression can increase this to
    2--3.

6.2 Skill Categories

Skills fall into broad functional categories:

-   **Combat Skills:** Trigger during attacks (e.g., Astra: 5
    consecutive hits at half damage; Sol: heal for damage dealt; Luna:
    ignore half of enemy DEF).

-   **Passive Skills:** Always active (e.g., Wrath: +20 Crit when below
    50% HP; Vantage: attack first when enemy initiates and HP is below
    50%).

-   **Command Skills:** Activated abilities with cooldowns or per-battle
    limits (e.g., Rally: +4 STR/SPD to adjacent allies for 1 turn).

-   **Personal Skills:** Unique to specific Lords and Special Characters
    (e.g., a Tactician Lord's personal skill might grant +2 to all stats
    for adjacent allies).

6.3 Starting Skills (Meta-Progression)

At the start of a run, units begin with no innate skills by default.
Through meta-progression, the player unlocks innate skills for classes:
one for the base class (available immediately) and one that activates on
promotion. The player can customize which skills their Lord starts with
from a pool of unlocked options. Starting equipped skills for the Lord
are also a meta-progression unlock.

7\. Equipment System

7.1 Equipment Slots

Each unit has two equipment slots: Weapon (required for combat;
determines attack type and range) and Accessory (optional; provides
passive stat bonuses and sometimes special abilities). Units can carry
up to 4 items total in their inventory (weapons, accessories,
consumables) and freely swap between battles.

7.2 Weapons

Weapons are categorized by type (Swords, Lances, Axes, Bows, Tomes,

                                                         Unique effects.
  ----------- ------------ ----------- ----------------- ------------------

Weapons do not break or require repair. Each weapon has stats: Might
(damage bonus), Hit (accuracy bonus), Crit (critical rate bonus), Weight
(reduces effective SPD if higher than unit's STR), and Range (1 for
melee, 2 for ranged, 1--2 for some magic).

7.3 Accessories

Accessories provide passive stat bonuses and sometimes unique effects.
Examples: Shield Ring (+3 DEF), Speed Ring (+3 SPD), Critical Band (+15
Crit), Renewal Ring (heal 10% HP per turn), Boots (+1 MOV). Accessories
come in common, uncommon, and rare tiers with corresponding stat
magnitudes.

7.4 Consumables

Consumables are single-use items found as loot or purchased: Vulnerary
(heal 10 HP), Elixir (heal to full), Promotion Item (required for
promotion), Stat Boosters (permanently increase one stat by 1--2), Skill
Scroll (grants an equipped skill). Consumables are lost at end of run.

8\. Roguelike Systems

8.1 Randomization

The following elements are randomized each run:

-   Node map paths (branching structure within each Act)

-   Battle maps (generated from templates with randomized terrain
    placement)

-   Enemy compositions (drawn from level-appropriate pools per Act)

-   Recruited unit stats (class growths rolled within ranges at
    recruitment)

-   Shop inventories (random selection from tier-appropriate item pools)

-   Loot drops (weapons, accessories, skill scrolls, consumables from
    tiered pools)

-   Level-up stat gains (each stat rolls against growth rate
    independently)

-   Elite/miniboss encounters (drawn from a pool, each with unique
    mechanics)

-   Fog of war and terrain modifiers (random chance per map)

-   Recruit event availability and which characters appear

8.2 Loot & Rewards

After each battle, the player is presented with a choice of loot.
Standard battles offer a choice of 1 from 3 random items. Elite battles
offer a choice of 2 from 4 items of higher quality. Boss battles grant a
guaranteed powerful reward plus meta-progression currency. Loot pools
scale by Act: Act 1 primarily offers Iron-tier gear and common
accessories; Act 2 introduces Steel-tier and uncommon accessories; Act 3
features Silver-tier and rare accessories; Post-Act and Bosses can drop
Legendary items.

8.3 Recruitment

Units are recruited during runs through two mechanisms:

-   **Recruit Event Nodes:** On the node map, recruit events are combat
    maps featuring a green NPC ally. The Lord must move adjacent to the
    NPC and use the Talk action to recruit them. The NPC fights with
    basic defensive AI and is not suicidal, but enemies may target them.
    If the NPC falls before recruitment, they are lost for this run.

-   **Mid-Battle Recruits:** Occasionally, a green NPC will appear on a
    standard battle map. Same recruitment mechanic. This is rarer and
    adds a secondary objective to the battle.

Recruited units are generated with: a random class (from the player's
unlocked class pool), a level appropriate to the current Act, randomized
stats based on class growths, a basic weapon appropriate to their class,
and no equipped skills (must be given Skill Scrolls).

8.4 Gold Economy

Gold is earned from battles (base amount + bonuses for performance),
selling unwanted loot, and sometimes from events. Gold is spent at shops
on weapons, accessories, consumables, skill scrolls, and promotion
items. Gold does not persist between runs. The economy should be tuned
so that players must make meaningful choices about what to buy rather
than purchasing everything.

9\. Meta-Progression

9.1 Meta-Currency

Runs award a meta-currency (working name: Renown) based on progress.
Renown is earned from: defeating bosses (large amounts), completing
Acts, total enemies defeated, and bonus objectives. Even failed runs
earn Renown proportional to progress. Renown is spent at the Home Base
between runs.

9.2 Home Base

The Home Base is the persistent hub between runs. It contains upgrade
stations where Renown is spent:

9.2.1 Lord Upgrades

-   Improve Lord's base growth rates (e.g., +5% STR growth, capped)

-   Improve Lord's starting base stats (+1 STR, +1 SPD, etc., capped)

-   Unlock additional weapon proficiencies for the Lord

-   Upgrade weapon proficiencies to Mastery

-   Unlock and customize starting skills (innate and equipped)

-   Unlock starting weapons (begin runs with better gear)

-   Unlock alternative Lord classes / promotion paths

9.2.2 Class & Recruit Upgrades

-   Unlock new classes for the recruitment pool

-   Improve generic recruit base stats and growth rate ranges

-   Unlock innate skills for base classes

-   Unlock innate skills for promoted classes

-   Increase equipped skill slot count (1 → 2 → 3)

-   Unlock new weapon proficiencies for classes

9.2.3 Special Character Unlocks

Special Characters are unique named units with fixed personal growth
rates and sometimes unique class trees. They are unlocked via
meta-progression and then appear in the recruitment pool during runs.
Unlike generic recruits, Special Characters retain their identity across
runs (same name, appearance, personal skill) but must still be recruited
each run. They start each run fresh but benefit from any class-level
meta-upgrades.

9.2.4 General Upgrades

-   Increase starting gold

-   Better starting shop inventories

-   Increase loot drop quality

-   Unlock additional node map events

-   NPC warriors (starting allies in early battles) get improved stats

9.3 Progression Balance Philosophy

Meta-progression should make early Acts feel smoother and open new
strategic options, but should never trivialize the late game. The
strongest upgrades (starting stats, growth rates) are capped to prevent
overpowering. The most impactful unlocks are lateral (new classes, new
Lords, new Special Characters) rather than strictly vertical. A fully
upgraded Lord with a team of clerics should still lose to Act 3 content
because maps demand multiple competent combat units through split-path
objectives and multi-front battles.

10\. Lord Profiles

10.1 Default Lord: Edric (Lord → Great Lord)

The starting Lord, available from the first run. A balanced
sword-wielding leader in the mold of Marth and Eliwood.

  ---------- -------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  **Stat**   **HP**   **STR**   **MAG**   **SKL**   **SPD**   **DEF**   **RES**   **LCK**   **MOV**

  Base       20       6         2         7         7         5         3         6         5

  Growth     70%      50%       20%       55%       55%       35%       30%       50%       ---
  ---------- -------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------

**Personal Skill --- Charisma:** Allies within 2 tiles gain +10 Hit and
+5 Avoid.

**Promotion:** Great Lord gains Lances (P), +2 STR, +1 DEF, +1 MOV.

10.2 Unlockable Lords (Examples)

Additional Lords are unlocked through meta-progression. Each offers a
fundamentally different playstyle:

-   **Kira (Tactician → Grandmaster):** Hybrid mage/support. Personal
    Skill: Foresight (+1 range on all Tome attacks). Starts with Tomes
    (P), promotes to Tomes (M) + Swords (P). Lower HP/DEF but high
    MAG/SPD. Rewards a magic-heavy team composition.

-   **Voss (Ranger → Vanguard):** Aggressive frontliner. Personal Skill:
    Resolve (+4 STR/DEF when below 50% HP). Starts with Swords (P),
    promotes to Swords (M) + Axes (P). Very high STR/DEF but lower
    SPD/RES. Rewards an aggressive, high-risk playstyle.

-   **Sera (Light Sage → Light Priestess):** Defensive/sustain lord.
    Personal Skill: Renewal Aura (adjacent allies heal 5 HP per turn).
    Starts with Light (P), promotes to Light (M) + Staves (P). Can both
    deal magic damage and heal. Lower offensive stats but exceptional at
    keeping teams alive.

11\. Enemy & Boss Design

11.1 Enemy Scaling

Enemies scale by Act. Each Act has a pool of enemy unit types at
appropriate levels with appropriate equipment:

  ---------- --------------- --------------- ------------------------------
  **Act**    **Enemy Level   **Equipment     **Class Variety**
             Range**         Tier**          

  Act 1      1--5            Iron            Fighters, Soldiers, Archers,
                                             Brigands

  Act 2      5--12           Iron/Steel      Above + Cavaliers, Mages,
                                             Knights, Mercenaries

  Act 3      12--18          Steel/Silver    Above + Swordmasters, Snipers,
                                             Sages, Generals, Promoted
                                             enemies

  Post-Act   16--20          Silver          Fully promoted enemies with
                                             skills
  ---------- --------------- --------------- ------------------------------

11.2 Elite Enemies (Minibosses)

Elites are named enemies with higher stats, unique skills, and sometimes
unique AI behaviors. They are drawn randomly from a pool. Examples: a
General with Pavise (chance to halve damage) who turtles behind a wall
of soldiers; an Assassin with Lethality (chance of instant kill) who
targets your weakest unit; a Sage with Bolting (long-range magic) who
must be reached through a gauntlet.

11.3 Act Bosses

Act Bosses are fixed (non-random) encounters designed to be learnable.
Each has a unique map layout, reinforcement pattern, and boss mechanics.
They are the primary difficulty gates and the source of the best
rewards. Boss design should test different tactical skills: Act 1 Boss
tests basic weapon triangle and positioning; Act 2 Boss tests
multi-front management and objective prioritization; Act 3 Boss tests
full team coordination with promoted enemies and boss mechanics.

11.4 Final Boss

The Final Boss is a multi-phase encounter on a large map. It should
require the player's full 6-unit roster operating at peak effectiveness.
The Final Boss has multiple phases, reinforcements, and unique mechanics
that test mastery of all game systems.

12\. Asset Requirements

12.1 Art Assets

12.1.1 Character Sprites (Map View)

Top-down or 3/4 view sprites for the game map. Each class needs: idle
animation (2 frames), walk animation (4 frames, 4 directions), and a
selected/highlighted state. At minimum 15--20 class sprite sets are
needed. Resolution: 32x32 pixels per frame recommended (or 16x16 for a
more retro feel). Palette: define a consistent 32-color master palette.
Each faction (player, enemy, NPC) uses color-swapped variants of the
same sprites.

12.1.2 Character Sprites (Battle View)

Side-view sprites for combat animations. Each class needs: idle (2
frames), attack (4--6 frames), hit/damage (2 frames), dodge (2--4
frames), critical attack (6--8 frames), and defeat/death (4 frames).
These are larger sprites: 64x64 or 96x96 recommended. This is the most
art-intensive requirement. For MVP, consider using minimal battle
animations (attack flash + damage number) and adding full animations
later.

12.1.3 Portraits

Character portraits for dialogue, recruitment, and stat screens. Lords
and Special Characters need unique portraits. Generic recruits can share
class-based portraits with color variations. Resolution: 96x96 or
128x128. This is a strong candidate for AI image generation --- generate
portraits in a consistent pixel art style, then manually clean up for
consistency.

12.1.4 Map Tilesets

Tile-based map graphics for 3--4 biome types (grassland/plains,
castle/fortress, cave/dungeon, forest). Each biome needs: base terrain
tiles, terrain features (trees, rocks, walls, water, bridges), objective
tiles (throne, gate, chest), and decorative elements. Standard tilesets
from itch.io or OpenGameArt are recommended as a starting point.

12.1.5 UI Elements

Menu backgrounds, stat screen layout, health bars, XP bar,
weapon/skill/item icons, cursor sprites, tile highlights (movement
range, attack range, selected), damage numbers, level-up screen, node
map graphics, and shop interface. A clean pixel-art UI kit is essential.

12.1.6 Effects

Visual effects for: weapon attacks (slash, pierce, impact), magic (fire,
lightning, wind, light, dark), healing (staff glow), critical hit flash,
level-up sparkle, promotion transformation, and status effects. These
can be simple sprite animations: 4--8 frames each.

12.2 Sound Assets

12.2.1 Sound Effects

Essential sound effects: menu cursor move, menu select, menu cancel,
attack hit (physical), attack hit (magical), critical hit, miss/dodge,
healing, level up jingle, unit defeated, gold received, item obtained,
skill activated, chapter clear fanfare, game over sting, node map
selection, and shop purchase. Free resources: OpenGameArt.org,
Freesound.org, or retro-style SFX generators like sfxr/jsfxr.

12.2.2 Music

Minimum music tracks needed: title screen theme, home base theme, node
map theme, standard battle theme, boss battle theme, final boss theme,
victory fanfare, game over theme, and recruitment/event theme. Chiptune
or orchestral-chip hybrid (Octopath Traveler style) fits the aesthetic.
AI music generation tools (Suno, Udio) or royalty-free retro game music
packs are viable options.

12.3 Asset Pipeline Recommendations

For practical development:

-   Use placeholder art during prototyping (colored rectangles, simple
    shapes).

-   Source tilesets from free asset packs on itch.io (many excellent
    SNES-style RPG tilesets exist).

-   Use AI image generation for portraits and concept art, with manual
    cleanup in Aseprite or Piskel.

-   For character sprites, consider hiring a pixel artist for the core
    set (15--20 classes) or using free sprite packs as a foundation.

-   Sound effects can be generated with jsfxr for retro-style SFX.

-   Music should be sourced from royalty-free packs or commissioned
    separately.

The highest-priority art for MVP is: map tilesets (1 biome), character
map sprites (5--6 classes), basic UI, and placeholder battle animations.

13\. Data Architecture

13.1 Data-Driven Design

All game content is defined in JSON files that the engine reads at
runtime. This enables rapid iteration, easy balancing, and eventual
modding support. Core data files include:

  ------------------- ---------------------- -------------------------------

                      by tier                
  ------------------- ---------------------- -------------------------------

13.2 Save Data

Two types of persistent data: Meta Save (Renown balance, all unlocked
upgrades, unlocked Lords/Special Characters/classes, Lord customization)
and Run Save (current Act/node position, full state of all units
including stats/equipment/skills, inventory, gold, map seed). Meta Save
persists forever via browser localStorage. Run Save is deleted on run
completion or failure.

14\. MVP Scope & Build Order

14.1 MVP Definition

The MVP is a playable vertical slice demonstrating the core loop:
navigate a node map, fight grid-based battles with varied objectives,
recruit units, find loot, level up and promote, fight a boss, and
experience meta-progression. It should include 1 full Act (6--8
battles + 1 boss) and a functional Home Base.

14.2 Build Order

Development should proceed in this order, with each phase producing a
testable result:

1.  **Grid Engine & Movement:** Render a tiled map, place units,
    implement movement ranges and pathfinding. Placeholder art (colored
    squares).

2.  **Combat System:** Implement the damage formula, weapon triangle,
    attack/counterattack, turn phases, and basic enemy AI. This is the
    core --- it must feel right.

3.  **Unit System:** Stats, leveling, growth rates, promotion, weapon
    ranks. Load class data from JSON.

4.  **Equipment & Skills:** Implement equipment effects, skill triggers,
    inventory management.

5.  **Map Generation:** Procedural map generation from templates with
    randomized terrain. Multiple objective types.

6.  **Node Map & Between-Battle Layer:** Branching path selection,
    shops, rest, recruit events.

7.  **Run Loop:** Full run from start to boss: loot drops, recruitment,
    gold economy, run failure.

8.  **Meta-Progression:** Home Base, Renown system, upgrade purchases,
    persistence via localStorage.

9.  **Polish & Art:** Replace placeholders with real sprites, add
    animations, sound effects, music, UI polish.

14.3 Post-MVP Features

Features to add after the MVP is solid: Acts 2 and 3 with escalating
content, additional Lord characters, Special Character roster, full
battle animations, fog of war, additional biomes and tilesets, more
skills and equipment variety, narrative/dialogue system, final boss
multi-phase encounter, and additional meta-progression depth.
